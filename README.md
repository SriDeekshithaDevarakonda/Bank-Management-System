The aim of this project is to simulate a basic banking system using C programming. The program allows users to perform essential banking operations such as opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and displaying account details. It ensures data integrity by validating user inputs (e.g., checking the mobile number format and sufficient balance for withdrawals) and allows multiple transactions in a user-friendly manner. The project helps in understanding the fundamentals of structures in C, file handling, and basic input-output operations in a banking context.
